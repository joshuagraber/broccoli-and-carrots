Data Structures and Algorithms in Typescript

## Overview

_Note: this is primarily for my own learning. I'll aim to keep test coverage at 100%, but I have made this to practice 1. DSA and 2. Publishing and maintaining an npm package. Test and confirm for yourself before importing and using._

## Data Structures

| Structure                 | Type                              | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Linked List][LinkedList] | Sequence (linear, not contiguous) | This is a [Doubly Linked List][DoublyLinkedList]             |
| [Stack][Stack]            | Sequence (linear, not contiguous) | Uses a `LinkedList` with the tail as the head of the `Stack` |
