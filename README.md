Data Structures and Algorithms in Typescript

## Overview

_Note: this is primarily for my own learning. I'll aim to keep test coverage at 100%, but I have made this to practice 1. DSA and 2. Publishing and maintaining an npm package. Test and confirm for yourself before importing and using._

## Data Structures

| Structure                           | Type     | Notes                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Linked List][LinkedList]           | Sequence | This is a [Doubly Linked List][DoublyLinkedListWiki]                     |
| [Stack][Stack]                      | Sequence | Uses a `LinkedList` with the tail as the head of the [Stack][StackWiki]  |
| [Queue][Queue]                      | Sequence | Uses a `LinkedList` with the head as the front of the [Queue][QueueWiki] |
| [Deque (Double-ended Queue)][Deque] | Sequence | Uses a `LinkedList` with the head as the front of the [Deque][QueueWiki] |
| [Circular Buffer][CircularBuffer]   | Sequence | Uses JS array as case of [Buffer][BufferWiki]                            |
